<a href="https://youtu.be/G1G9D8A4Fiw" target="_blank"><font size= 30px>Manowar - Warriors of the World</font></a><br>
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world<br>
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry<br>
All are gathered here, victory is near<br>
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all<br>
<br>
We alone are fighting for metal that is true<br>
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you<br>
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry<br>
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky<br>
<br>
Brothers everywhere raise your hands into the air<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
Like thunder from the sky sworn to fight and die<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
<br>
Many stand against us, but they will never win<br>
We said we would return and here we are again<br>
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain<br>
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.<br>
<br>
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands<br>
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man<br>
I call them out and charge them all with a life that is a lie<br>
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die<br>
<br>
Brothers everywhere raise your hands into the air<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
Like thunder from the sky sworn to fight and die<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
<br>
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side<br>
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died<br>
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real<br>
All who stand in my way will die by steel<br>
<br>
Brothers everywhere raise your hands into the air<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
Like thunder from the sky sworn to fight and die<br>
We're warriors, warriors of the world<br>
